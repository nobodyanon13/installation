# installation V2Ray Docker Compose

This repository contains sample Docker Compose files to run upstream and bridge V2Ray servers.

## Documentation

### Terminology

* Upstream Server: A server that has free access to the Internet.
* Bridge Server: A server that is available to clients and has access to an upstream server.
* Client: A user-side application with access to the bridge server.

```
[ Client ] <-> [ Bridge Server ] <-> [ Upstream Server ] <-> [ Internet ]
```

### Setup

#### UUIDs

V2Ray uses the VMESS protocol as the primary protocol.
The VMESS protocol requires UUIDs for security reasons (instead of passwords).
We need two UUIDs for the two V2Ray servers (upstream and bridge servers).

You can generate UUIDs:

1- Online:

[https://www.uuidgenerator.net](https://www.uuidgenerator.net)

2- The Linux command:

```bash
cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid
```

Sample UUIDs:
* `cfc3ac34-a70d-424e-b43c-33049cf4bf31`
* `143d98d8-ac89-465a-acb5-d8d51e1f851f`


#### Upstream Server

To setup the upstream server:
1. Copy the "v2ray_upstream_server" directory into the upstream server.
2. Replace `<UPSTREAM-UUID>` in the `config.json` file with the generated UUID for the upstream server.
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`.

#### Bridge Server

To setup the bridge server:
1. Copy the "v2ray_bridge_server" directory into bridge server.
2. Replace the following variables in the `config.json` file with appropriate values.
    * `<SHADOWSOCKS-PASSWORD>`: A password for ShadowSocks like `!FR33DoM!`.
    * `<BRIDGE-UUID>`: The generated UUID for the bridge server.
    * `<UPSTREAM-SERVER-IP>`: The upstream server IP address like `13.13.13.13`.
    * `<UPSTREAM-UUID>`: The generated UUID for the upstream server.
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`. 

#### Clients

The bridge server exposes these proxy protocols:
* HTTP
* ShadowSocks
* VMESS

##### ShadowSocks Protocol

ShadowSocks is a popular proxy protocol.
You can find many client apps to use the ShadowSocks proxy on your devices.
These are recommended client apps:
* [ShadowSocks for macOS](https://github.com/shadowsocks/ShadowsocksX-NG/releases)
* [ShadowSocks for Linux](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev)
* [ShadowSocks for Windows](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-windows/releases)
* [ShadowSocks for Android](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-android/releases)
* [ShadowLink for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shadowlink-shadowsocks-vpn/id1439686518)
* [Potatso Lite for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/potatso-lite/id1239860606)

Client configuration:
```
IP: <BRIDGE-SERVER-IP>
Port: 1012
Encryption (Algorithm): aes-128-gcm
Password: <SHADOWSOCKS-PASSWORD>
```

##### VMESS Protocol

The VMESS proxy protocol is the recommended one.
It's the primary protocol that V2Ray provides.
These are recommended client apps:
* [V2RayX for macOS](https://github.com/Cenmrev/V2RayX/releases)
* [v2ray-core for Linux](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core)
* [v2rayN for Windows](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN/releases)
* [ShadowLink for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shadowlink-shadowsocks-vpn/id1439686518)
* [v2rayNG for Android](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayNG)

Client configuration:
```
IP: <BRIDGE-SERVER-IP>
Port: 1013
User ID: <BRIDGE-UUID>
Alter ID: 10
Level: 0
Security (Encryption): aes-128-gcm
Network: TCP
```

##### HTTP Protocol

The HTTP proxy is for internal usage on the bridge server and would be exposed only to the 127.0.0.1 IP address without password.
For example, the command below shows how to use it on the bridge server terminal.
The cURL response should be the upstream server IP address.

```shell
export http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1011;export https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1011;
curl ifconfig.io
```

You can use the HTTP proxy on your local device using port forwarding, as well.
The following command makes the HTTP proxy on the bridge server available to the local device and private network it uses.

```
ssh -NL 1011:0.0.0.0:1011 root@<BRIDGE-SERVER-IP>
```
